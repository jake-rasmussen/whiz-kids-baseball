# Whiz Kids Website

This is a website created for a travel baseball organization based out of Philadelphia.

## Features

The ultimate goal of the website was to make something with longevity that could be easily managed for years by any Whiz Kids Admins. So, we created an Admin
backend, where the Admin has an access to CRUD operations for:

  - A team's tournaments, practices, and roster
  - The actual list of teams
  - Training and tryout schedule 
  - List of alumni

The website is also equipped with Clerk, a User Management System that also provides 2FA. As a user, people can sign up for listed trainings, and also automatically
has their accounts registered with the Newsletter, which the Admin can send out via the backend as well. Additionally, the Admin has the ability to remove user's
from trainings if they see fit. 

It's important to note that all backend pages are protected, so the user must have a verified Admin account in order to see anything in the backend.
